# My resume

I used to have Adobe InDesign. A while back I spent nearly a full Saturday trying to get my resume layout correct on a variety of open source editors that didn't really work for me. 

Then I realized that I know of some way to lay out and style text and it is called HTML. It works. Why didn't I think of that before?
